# Next.js 15 - Unhandled error in Edge Runtime

This repository demonstrates an issue with unhandled errors within the Next.js 15 Edge Runtime, specifically concerning errors thrown in API routes or pages. While Next.js 15 offers improvements in error handling, unexpected errors may lead to unexpected runtime behavior. 

## Issue Description

When an unhandled error occurs within a page or API route, Next.js's error handling mechanism might not always provide expected results in the Edge Runtime.  This can lead to inconsistent behavior and difficulties in debugging and managing exceptions.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project's directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
5. Navigate to `/about`. You will see the error, but the error handling might not be as expected.

## Solution

The solution involves robust error handling within the problematic components using try...catch blocks.  Ideally, Next.js should provide improved and more explicit ways to manage errors originating in the Edge Runtime.

## Further Improvements

- Better integration with centralized error logging services. 
- More user-friendly error messages that provide clearer insight into error causes and locations. 
- Enhanced debugging tools for streamlining the process of identifying and resolving such errors within the Edge Runtime.
